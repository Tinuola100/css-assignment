 <p>Inductive reasoning is a form of logical thinking that uses related observations to arrive at a general
    conclusion. This type of reasoning is common in descriptive science. A life scientist such as a biologist
    makes observations and records them. These data can be qualitative or quantitative, and the raw
    data can be supplemented with drawings, pictures, photos, or videos. From many observations, the
    scientist can infer conclusions  (inductions) based on evidence. Inductive reasoning involves formulating
    generalizations inferred from careful observation and the analysis of a large amount of data. Brain studies
    provide an example. In this type of research, many live brains are observed while people are doing a
    specific activity, such as viewing images of food. The part of the brain that “lights up” during this activity
    is then predicted to be the part controlling the response to the selected stimulus, in this case, images of
    food. The “lighting up” of the various areas of the brain is caused by excess absorption of radioactive
    sugar derivatives by active areas of the brain. The resultant increase in radioactivity is observed by a
    scanner. Then, researchers can stimulate that part of the brain to see if similar responses result.
    Deductive reasoning or deduction is the type of logic used in hypothesis-based science. In deductive
    reason, the pattern of thinking moves in the opposite direction as compared to inductive reasoning.
    Deductive reasoning is a form of logical thinking that uses a general principle or law to forecast specific
    results. From those general principles, a scientist can extrapolate and predict the specific results that
    would be valid as long as the general principles are valid. Studies in climate change can illustrate this
    type of reasoning. For example, scientists may predict that if the climate becomes warmer in a particular
    region, then the distribution of plants and animals should change. These predictions have been made and
    tested, and many such changes have been found, such as the modification of arable areas for agriculture,
    with change based on temperature averages.
    Both types of logical thinking are related to the two main pathways of scientific study: descriptive
    science and hypothesis-based science. Descriptive (or discovery) science, which is usually inductive,
    aims to observe, explore, and discover, while hypothesis-based science, which is usually deductive,
    begins with a specific question or problem and a potential answer or solution that can be tested. The
    boundary between these two forms of study is often blurred, and most scientific endeavors combine both
    approaches.</p>
